                <p>
                    Mero provides their proprietary sensor technology and their
                    accompanying software as a service (SaaS) to building
                    managers.

                <p>
                    Mero had a prototype that was gaining traction with
                    customers and realized strong demand in the marketplace.
                    They approached Alora to develop a market-ready version of
                    their product that could be commercialized and adhere to the
                    drastic demand they were receiving. Encompassing their early
                    customersâ€™ feedback and building a more scalable system was
                    a priority.

                <h2 class="h3">Results</h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the entire stack from the ground up, using AWS
                    for the backend infrastructure and Laravel for the web
                    application. The software allows for the provisioning of new
                    sensors, setting staff schedules and provides value to
                    building managers by optimizing cleaner visits and
                    visualizing efficiency metrics. This successful launch
                    allowed them to sign on additional customers and raise VC
                    investment.
